#### Personal Development Plan

2 Strong points:
- Determination. Having the inner courage to do everything, that needs to be done in order to achieve the goal that i have put in front of myself. Forcing myself to do the things i need to do, even when i dont feel like it, is something which makes me treat myself to a higher standard and also makes me enjoy the sweet fruit of reward much more when said goal has been achieved and achieved with high remarks.
- Good spirit and being nice in general. Being able to make a certain situation less intimidating for a single person or a group of people is very important to me so i give it my all when somebody is strugling or is in need of some sort of help. If someone is having a bad day and you make them smile for just 10 seconds that person would be gratefull to you for the rest of the day. So having the abillity to help out my teammates whether its when we are stuck on a certain problem or just make everyone smile and be motivated so that they can do their best work is something i aspire to.
 
2 Weaker points:
- Procrastination and laziness. I have been strugling with these two since i was a small child but i try my best every single day to just make them dissapear little by little so that it dosen't affect my work and the essentials of what i have to do to achieve.
- Not a lot of experience with CS in general. I am a medium pace learner of sorts and Computer Science has a lot of things that need to be inherited at a quick pace so i find myself sometimes strugling to stay a float.

My goals:

1. Experience what it's like to work in a real Software Team enviroment so that i could more easily get acquainted with the way work is done in this whole industry for later down the road.
2. Get to grip with software and programing on a more in-depth scale and see what areas of my CS skills i need to work on so that i can contribute more effectively to my team now and later on when working for an actual Software company.

#### Personal Development Plan

2 Strong points:
- Perseverance. I don’t like when I dash off my work. So really try my hardest to know as much as I can. This is because I think that you need a good foundation of previous material before you start branching off into material which depends on that knowledge. This point is shown in the team in that I really try to finish my part of the work. I think peer pressure is a good thing in this case since I don’t want to let my team down by giving up on my work.
- Organized. I want a clear definition of what I’m doing before I start. This way I reduce the chance of digression from what must be done. In the team I think this help with knowing what we are all up to instead of digressing too much.

2 Weaker points
- Time Management. Trying to work out all the details takes a lot of time and taking the time to sort all the work doesn’t help either. I think in a group this isn’t really a problem since I really get that extra bit of motivation from working with a team to do the work immediately.
- Control freak. I don’t like it when I don’t know what something (or somebody) is doing. This sounds bad, but from previous experience from working in teams I have learned from my mistakes. Everybody knows what they are doing, so why do I feel the need to take over? That is what I ask myself. So, I’ll try to use the good parts of being a control freak, that is, being in control of what I’m doing instead of someone else is doing.

Quality 1: Perseverance -> Pitfall: Bad time management -> Challenge: Prioritize your work -> Allergy: Dashing off

Quality 2: Organized -> Pitfall: Control Freak -> Challenge: Focus only on my work -> Allergy: Disorganized

My goals
1. I want to extend my knowledge on programming. This is of obviously important since there is a lot to learn. I achieved this, when I have a good understanding of how all parts of our program work in coherence with each other. To achieve this, I will be learning through collaboration with my team, documentation and other learning material. I hope to learn from mistakes. I think testing is an important tool to understand your mistakes. I think the best thing to do now is to design and program the things that are on the planning and keep doing that throughout the project.
2. This is the more important goal in my opinion. I want to gain more experience on working in a team and learn how to be a meaningful addition to the team. This is very important to me since (software) engineering is nowadays all about collaborating. I achieved this when I have reflected and learned from the feedback of my team. So, this depends on what my team will think of my actions during the project. Whether good or bad, I hope to learn from it to do even better next time. To actively be working on learning from my actions I can ask my teammates for their opinions and feedback. That can be done by e.g. asking about the usefulness of my action.

#### Personal Development Plan

Two of my strong points:
- Commitment, I work seriously on my tasks and always try my best.
- Supportive, I'm always willing to help my teammates with their tasks or explain things they don't understand to them.

Two of my weaker points:
- Lazy, I am quite lazy, so I usually prefer people telling me what to do (preferably the easy tasks). In a team I usually do what I am told to do without thinking about it. This ends up in me not understanding my tasks and not doing a good job.
- Perfectionist, when I do get what's going on I feel like I need to make everything look perfect and that can lead to me pushing my way of doing it onto other people. 

Core quadrants:

Commitment -> pitfall: bad time management -> challenge: don't focus too much on one thing -> allergy: slacking off

Supportive -> pitfall: annoying -> challenge: don't do more than you've been asked to -> allergy: nonchalant

My goals:
1. I want to know how to work together on a project. This is important to me since I know that in the future, building anything will be done in a team, so it's important to learn how to work together without conflict. I will listen to the thoughts of my teammates, help them if they need help, let them help me if I need help and try to actively think of ways to improve our program and myself.
2. I want to know more about programming. This is obviously important since I study CSE. I want to know more about the different aspects of the code that builds the program, like the database and the UI. I will do this by understanding what my teammates coded and not work on one thing.

**NetID:** tpdanema

#### Personal development plan
**_Two of my stronger points:_**
* **Organized.**<br> I'm not one to start something and 'see what happens', when I start with something I usually try to plan everything out beforehand. 
For programs like this I like to make simple drawing of most models and how they interact with each other, effectively making the whole scheme on paper first. 
This might sound inefficient, but I've come to realize this strategy is usually faster in the long run.<br>
 I suppose this will help the team by preventing us from developing things needlessly.
* **Eager to learn.**<br> I don't mind spending extra time outside of school to get a better understanding of something.
This something can be a (programming) language, framework or something else entirely.<br>
This should be useful in a team project because I'm always willing to spend extra time understanding something to explain it later to teammates who do not yet fully understand something or require help.

<br>**_Two of my weaker points:_**
* **Control freak.**<br>
The reason why I sometimes prefer working alone is because I'm in control. 
I try to control a lot of things, and want to know what everybody is doing. 
At first I always felt this was a good thing, at least someone was in control. 
But as I did more group projects in highschool, it became apparent this characteristic was not very useful and more often than not caused a conflict with other 'control freaks'. <br>
In a team I might look bossy or a know-it-all.
* **Difficulty with pacing myself.**<br>
This is the one thing that I really struggle with in group assignments, especially when I like the project. 
When starting an assignment/project, more often than not I just want to sit down and complete it as fast as I can. 
Sometimes this is appreciated (mostly by groupmates who do not feel like doing much), but I suppose this might also be annoying for students who actually want to work on a project. 
It's also not like I don't feel like explaining things, it's the opposite actually.
I really like to explain stuff, but I also regularly forget people may just have started with programming/working with X, which sometimes causes them to be more confused after my 'explanation'.

<br>**_Core quadrants:_**<br>
*Organized* -> **Pitfall**: *Overly organized* -> **Challenge:** *Leave thing as they are* -> **Allergy:** *Disorganized*<br>
*Eager to learn* -> **Pitfall**: *Spending to much time on the project* -> **Challenge:** *Stop always trying to understand everything* -> **Allergy:** *Brainless copy-pasting*

<br>**_My goals:_**
1. **I want to expand my knowledge of the Spring framework, and RESTful APIs.**<br>
This is important to me because I personally really like working on the backend-side of projects, but I've never actually made a medium-big RESTful API from 'scratch' (quotation marks because of frameworks) in a team. 
I'm actively working on this goal, by creating a RESTful API with Spring in a team.<br>
We haven't really started development at the time of writing this plan, but at the moment I've managed to learn more about efficiently loading entity relations with JDA and Hibernate.<br>
I assume the best way to achieve this goal is by just doing it and having an active role in developing our backend. 
Another option is by making an extra API to give our project the most accurate CO2 values. 
However, my best option is by far the first one, since that will take the most effort. 
I will start on achieving this goal as soon as we start programming. At the moment I can just learn and practice.
2. **My second goal is to be more effective in working with a team.**<br>
I think this is something I definitely should work on because it is something that will be relevent my entire career (and probably even my entire life). 
Besides the obvious reason, I also think this is something I should work on for the sake of my future teammates.<br>
As I hinted in the previous sentence, teamwork is not really my strong suit.
I think the fact that I'm willing to explain is already a good thing, but my stubborness to sometimes not accept other people's insights might negate this.<br>
To help achieve this goal I should probably be more accepting of other people's ideas, and help them.

Personal Development Plan

Stronger:

Some of my strong points are being a communicative as well as a dedicated person. 
They are shown through the favorable way of interacting with the teammates and through the valuable quality of the end products I create during the projects I work on.

Weaker:

Two of my weaker points are stressing more than it would be necessary in the process of doing assignments and not knowing extra information related to programming that could be useful in these kinds of tasks.
They might be shown in a team by my attempts to solve as many things as possible in a short period of time and by the fact that I tend to accomplish the tasks that have been assigned to me more than taking initiative.

Goals:

Developing better teamwork abilities as well as gaining more experience with task management. I consider these ideas to be extremely important since the IT world requires you to be able to divide big assignments in many small brances distributed among the entire team. Moreover, this kind of environment also involves a lot of social skills.
Improving my programming knowledge which is an essential part in the process of becoming a computer scientist.

#### Personal Development Plan

2 Strong Points 

* Previous working experience in a start-up consisting of web-based development on Node, Angular & React, Git therefore I’m aware of what it’s like to be in a professional environment.

* Positive attitude & commitment – not afraid to jump out of my usual comfort zone to go above & beyond my assigned tasks, help others when they’re stuck and see things through to the end. 

2 Weaker Points

* Haven’t programmed professionally in Java before – intimidating new frameworks and learning their functionalities and their effective usage scenarios. 

* Procrastination comes naturally. For me, personally, this how I produce my best output by procrastinating - maybe it’s the adrenaline rush of the thrill of working close to deadlines.

Core Quadrant

Quality: absorb info quickly ->Pitfall: learn irrelevant things ->Challenge: effective use of knowledge->Allergy: Take time for simple concepts 

Quality: Commitment ->Pitfall: spend excessive time->Challenge: timely done tasks->Allergy: procrastination

#### My learning Goals

* Learn industry-standard frameworks/libraries by experimenting and get the most out of them to build high-quality software, by producing quality code according to specifications using best practices.  

* Improve problem-solving and critical thinking skills to come up with creative solutions by making judgment calls and trade-off analysis. 

* Since the project is more about software engineering methods than programming, it’s a good idea to learn about modern development processes like agile and software-development life cycles.

* Having professional, friendly and open team communication to clearly get ideas across the group and be open to constructive criticism.

* Efficient time-management – prioritise tasks in an effective workflow environment using scrum methods.


#### Steps to Achieve Goal

* After setting my goals, I need actively start working towards my goals this can be done by:

* Having the right mindset – dedication and passion to build a complete end-to-end product which will serve as an achievement to myself and motivate me further to do more.

* Make side projects and build something that it is standalone which can be used in the final build and learning from its inevitable failures.   

* Revisit OOP from Q1 which has a lot of transferrable skills and refresh my memory on the fundamentals of MVC and key skills learnt during the course.

* We’re in the 21st century and have numerous resources and tools at our disposal to take advantage of such as Google, StackOverflow, Books and of course team members past experiences. With my teammates we can: brainstorm, get new ideas and creative juices flowing and think in different perspectives.
