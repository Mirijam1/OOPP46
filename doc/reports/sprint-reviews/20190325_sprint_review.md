# Sprint Review Week 6

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Not a lot of progress
- Due to a poor division of tasks we didn't know who was doing what exactly, that caused some confusion.
    

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- "Life is a roller coaster, we go up and down; sometimes sideways." -Shah Farooq 2k19 -> Sums up that we slacked off a bit this week


## Adjustments for next sprint
- Realise that we need more meetings, we'll need to compensate work for this week
