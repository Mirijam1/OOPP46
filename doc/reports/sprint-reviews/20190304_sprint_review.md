# Sprint Review Week 3

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Communication
- There was insufficient communication between members
    - To mitigate this, we have decided to put more emphasis on updating each other, updating the scrum board etc...

### Problem 2: (Has to do with problem 1) Finishing our tasks
- Because of insufficient communication, It wasn't clear what to complete for the this sprint
-   - We think that following the guidelines in problem 1 will help solve this
    

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- We didn't have a proper sprint yet

## Adjustments for next sprint
- Better communication
