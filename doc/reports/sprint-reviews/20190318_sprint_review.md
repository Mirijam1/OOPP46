# Sprint Review Week 5

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Not a lot of progress
- There was sufficient communication, but mostly due to the midterms we had a dip in progress
- We have some catching up to do, but overall our progress is still healthy

### Problem 2: maybe?
    

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- Communication is better from last time, tasks completed before time. Slight dip in productivity, but probably due to midterms.

## Adjustments for next sprint
- Better communication and more actual code output from each team member.
