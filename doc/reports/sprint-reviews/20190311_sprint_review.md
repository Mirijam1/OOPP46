# Sprint Review Week 4

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Not having tasks to do
- There was insufficient communication between members in the first sprint review we had additional meeting on Thursday last week(which was productive!)
-  Solved by creating a fake request method to be used as sample data to off-load backend deadlines to match front-end development

### Problem 2: maybe?
    

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- Communication is better from last time, tasks completed before time. 

## Adjustments for next sprint
- Better communication and more actual code output from each team member.
