#Meeting 2

##Opening

##Approval of the agenda
> Make sure to add comments here if you don't agree with the agenda or want to add something

##Homework (Not mandatory but comes in handy)
Make a list with all functionality that the program has to contain. (So basically a draft product backlog.)
Try to prioritize every feature.

##Points of Action
- Stand-up meeting with TA
- Assign chair-role (or Scrum master) for today and for upcoming weeks
- Discuss miscellaneous stuff with TA
- Set-up Trello or GitLab issues (depending on whether we're allowed to use Trello)
- Discuss dev branch development
- Create the product backlog
    - Compare “homework”
	- Prioritize the features of the app
	- Add it to Trello or GitLab issues
- Divide tasks (creating the sprint backlog) / Make planning
- (Unlikely, but possible) Start programming

##Any other business
- Discuss cake-rule

##Questions
- Are we allowed to use Trello?
- Should the chair-role be the one taking the notes?

##Closing
